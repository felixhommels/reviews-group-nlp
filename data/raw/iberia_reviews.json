    "text": "Lack of Professionalism and PassionIberia\u2019s employees consistently display a disturbing lack of commitment and professionalism. There is no trace of m\u00edstica \u2014 no sense of service or pride in their work. Passengers are treated as obstacles, not clients. This toxic attitude permeates every interaction and gives the impression that helping customers is an unwanted chore.Dirty and Deteriorated AircraftMoreover, the physical state of some of their aircrafts is unacceptable. Many planes are in visible disrepair: dirty cabins, worn seats, and unkempt interiors that suggest neglect rather than national pride. The experience often feels closer to a low-cost regional bus than a flagship European carrier.Customer service designed to exhaust you, worse yet is Iberia\u2019s so-called customer service, which is clearly engineered to frustrate. It\u2019s nearly impossible to reach a human being. Their communication channels lead to automated dead ends, delays, and circular excuses \u2014 all part of a strategy to wear passengers down until they abandon their claims. This is not inefficiency; it\u2019s deliberateA Culture of Contempt.Iberia does not merely fail at service \u2014 it shows open contempt for the people who pay for its existence. The company culture seems to have normalized mediocrity and disregard, and that attitude filters down to every level of the customer journey. Avoid Iberia unless absolutely necessary. If you expect dignity, cleanliness, and even the most basic human decency in service, this airline will not meet your standards. Iberia is not just a disappointment \u2014 it\u2019s an insult.",

    "text": "I recently had the unfortunate experience of traveling with Iberia Airlines on a flight from Boston to Barcelona, and I feel compelled to share my deeply disheartening journey. From the outset, my anticipation for this once-in-a-lifetime trip to Spain was marred by a severe mishap: the airline lost my baggage.Upon arrival in Barcelona, I eagerly anticipated reuniting with my suitcase, filled with essential items for my stay. However, what awaited me was a shocking realization: my bag was nowhere to be found. I immediately reached out to Iberia\u2019s customer service, hoping for prompt assistance and clarity. Regrettably, what ensued was a frustrating cycle of misinformation and contradictory statements.During my multiple calls to customer service, I was met with a barrage of lies and unhelpful responses from their representatives. Each conversation seemed to unravel further into confusion, as I was given promises of updates and timelines that never materialized. I was told that my luggage would be located and delivered imminently, only to be left waiting and wondering, feeling increasingly abandoned.The sheer incompetence of Iberia\u2019s employees turned what should have been a joyous exploration of Spanish culture into an ordeal overshadowed by anxiety and disappointment. The emotional toll of this loss was significant; I found myself unable to fully immerse in the experiences I had long anticipated, as my thoughts were consumed by the whereabouts of my belongings.This trip was meant to be a celebration of new adventures, yet it became a bitter reminder of the shortcomings in Iberia's service. The lack of accountability and effective communication from the airline not only disrupted my travel plans but also marred the entirety of my experience in Spain.I sincerely hope Iberia acknowledges that customer service is not merely a function of answering calls, but a representation of their brand and the experiences they create for their passengers. I urge potential travelers to consider this account when choosing their airline, as my encounter reflects a disconcerting reality regarding Iberia\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction.In conclusion, my experience with Iberia Airlines has been profoundly disappointing, and the loss of my baggage, coupled with a lack of competent support, has left a negative impression that I will not soon forget. I hope for a resolution, but more importantly, I hope that Iberia takes steps to ensure that future travelers do not endure the same disheartening experience.",

    "text": "My very kind parents bought me a caravan on a campsite in my favourite area of Spain 2 years ago. I\u2019m disabled and also have over 30 medical conditions and because some of these conditions are very serious and will lower my expected lifespan our NHS provide me with a 24/7 live in carer. Anytime I go to visit Spain I always have to travel with my live in carer. I usually book all of my flights for the whole year after Christmas in their New Year sale. The flights are always British Airways flights from Gatwick to Alicante. Previously I have always booked directly with British Airways and because there\u2019s a high turnover of carers if my carer changes for any reason British Airways have always just required a short email from my care agency manager stating who my carer was and who it was now and within 10 minutes British Airways had changed the name on my carers ticket to the name of who I would be travelling with now. I presumed and was advised that because Iberia was still part of the One World Alliance Group that they should have the same rules. Anyone else in this situation please be very careful and please don\u2019t book with Iberia because I was last in Alicante from 24th March until 10th April and my carer lived in Spain and a few days into my last holiday my carer advised me that she was going to be leaving and so I advised her to talk to the manager of the care agency asap which she did and she agreed to stay on until they got another carer there with me which they managed within about 2 days. Because I still had the return ticket and also 5 other return tickets throughout the year I presumed that Iberia would have the same rules as British Airways but to my shock and horror they said that they didn\u2019t and they told me that it didn\u2019t matter what the circumstances were but they wouldn\u2019t change the name on the carers tickets! I ended up talking to Iberia on the phone about my situation every day for hours on end and to different agents. Most of the agents were very rude, showed no compassion at all and on many times they just cut my call off. I often asked to talk to a supervisor or manager but they always told me that there wasn\u2019t 1 available! I eventually managed to talk to a supervisor who offered to refund my carer tickets into vouchers and told me that if I wanted to use them to book with British Airways then I could because they were all part of One World Alliance. They did deduct \u00a315 off of each ticket though! But otherwise I was happy because I could now book with British Airways and so if there were any further changes with my carers I knew that I would have no problem in getting the name on the ticket changed. The prices had obviously increased though but I tried to book with British Airways the next morning only to be told that they couldn\u2019t accept these vouchers but I could still use them to book British Airways flights but it would have to be done through Iberia! So right back to where I started and having to make more telephone calls to Iberia. I got nowhere and for the whole 2 weeks of that holiday I ended up not going out anywhere on any day because I was always on the telephone trying to resolve my situation but without any success! I will never book with Iberia ever again. However even if you telephone British Airways Executive Club and asked them to change the name on a carers ticket they would probably tell you that they can\u2019t change the name on a carers ticket and it only seems to be British Airways Special Assistance team that are aware that they will change the name on a carers ticket. That team are wonderful and will always do their best for you and treat you with respect. I have the email address for the chief executive of British Airways because I\u2019m sure that he knows his equivalent in Iberia and if he wanted to help me I\u2019m sure that he could but I\u2019ve sent him 2 emails and not heard anything from him. My trips to Spain are the only thing that I\u2019ve got to look forward to now in my life and my next trip is booked for 7th May until 21st May but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to go or not! My average expected lifespan is only 64.7 years! Even if you book a carers ticket with EasyJet but book it at a much later date and even if the price is then much higher EasyJet will sell you it at the same price as you paid for your ticket and so it appears that Iberia seem to treat disabled and sick people worse than EasyJet!",

Everything was fine and looked normal, until the next day where Iberia cancelled my booking without any reason besides 'security reasons'. I tried to ring them and they couldn't even tell me why THEY cancelled the ticket! I thought because my mum was the one who booked that it gave a security message in the system but there are plenty of people whose family pay for their flight tickets. However, based on some reviews, this seems to be a frequent occurrence and at shorter notice. In any case their only advice was to rebook, and the price went up astronomically to which I had to book via third-party which is incredulous for a short-haul European flight. Luckily they refunded my mother's ticket within a couple days. Complete incompetence on their customer service and shocking that they can just cancel your flight as they please. Then, four months later when I board on the actual flight, I am appalled at what I saw. Old, worn seats. Flecks of dust and food particles. Brings shame to Spain as a nation if this is what they consider acceptable for their flagship airline. Additionally, the flight attendants only gave instructions, information, etc in Spanish, which was odd and inconvenient as every airline i have flown on they give instructions in both English + the native language.I will never fly Iberia again unless they improve on their customer service",

The economy seats are currently for sale on Expedia for about \u00a3744.I\u2019m shocked that an airline can do this and I will never ever fly with Iberia again",

    "text": "Iberia is the worst airline I've ever travelled with! I had a flight from Germany with a stopover in Madrid and then onwards to Brazil. I checked my luggage in Germany and it was never delivered to me. I filed a complaint directly when I arrived in Madrid, and was told that they knew where the luggage was and would send it to me the next day. I left Madrid four days later for Brazil without my luggage in my hands. Worst of all, I have to call frequently to get an update, and each time I'm told something different. I've heard that they don't know where the suitcase is, that it's in Madrid, and that it's in Germany. The only thing I'm sure of is that the luggage is not with me and it's already been 7 days without my belongings, my clothes and everything I had planned for my business stay in Brazil. They always treat me as if I'm a burden to them, and give very little importance to all the trouble they're causing me.",
